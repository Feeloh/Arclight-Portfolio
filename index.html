        <h5>Labour Hire </h5>
        <p>Having a Technical Department can be Expensive what if you outsource our Tradesmen on need basis.
          That is what we call that Profitability!!
        </p>
        <p><h4>Benefits of labour hire to businesses</h4></p> 
        <p><h5>Businesses stand to gain numerous benefits from labour hire, these include:</h5></p>
        <p>
          <strong>Reduced downtime.</strong>  Technicians provided by us are not suggestions to be considered but workers who have been vetted, trained, and deemed capable of taking on the role. This makes them ideal for emergency cover as they can come in and start working immediately reducing the impact of employee absences. 
        </p>
        <p>  
          <strong>Experience and expertise.</strong>  A labour hire arrangement enables you to bring in the specialised skills and experience you require for a certain project on hire basis without having to take on the employee full time. This means that you’ll not need to train your employees on a skill that will only be required once the project is complete. 
        </p>
        <p>  
          <strong>Flexibility.</strong>  For a lot of businesses, production requirements keep changing seasonally. Labour hire enables you to adjust your labour force to suit the current workload. You, therefore, don’t need to hire permanent staff that won’t be needed once the peak season or project is complete. 
        </p>
        <p>  
          <strong>Short notice and emergency cover.</strong>  Sometimes worker shortages cannot be foreseen such as when an employee falls ill or gets injured. We cover your labour shortfall minimising interruptions. 
        </p>
        <p>  
          <strong>Network.</strong> We have a large network of pre-screened technicians, they are able to fill a large number of positions simultaneously without compromising the quality of labour provided. 
        </p>
        <p>  
          <strong>Market knowledge.</strong> We have an in-depth understanding of the labour market for all of our services an have the  knowledge of available talent, their location and how to get them.  
        </p>  
        <p>
          If your company has varying and short-term labour needs the better option for you would greatly reduce recruitment costs and time the expense of hiring permanent workers.
